    Java Basics
This project covers the following Java basics:

        Variables: Declaration, initialization, and types.
        Data Types: Primitive types and reference types.
        Operators: Arithmetic, comparison, and logical operators.
        Control Statements: Conditional statements, loops, and switch statements.
        Classes: Declaring and instantiating classes.
        Objects: Creating and using objects.
        Constructors: Creating and using constructors.
        Methods: Creating and using methods.
        Packages: Organizing classes into packages.
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
This project covers the following OOP concepts:

        Abstraction: Creating abstract classes and interfaces.
        Inheritance: Extending classes and implementing interfaces.
        Polymorphism: Overloading and overriding methods.
        Encapsulation: Using access modifiers to control access to class members.
        Exception Handling
This project covers the basics of handling runtime errors and exceptions in Java.

This is a project containing implementations of various basic data structures and algorithms in Java. The purpose of this project is to help beginners learn how to implement these structures and algorithms, as well as to provide a reference for more experienced programmers.

Data Structures
The following data structures are implemented in this project:

    1. Linked List
    2. Stack
    3. Queue
    4 Binary Search Tree
Algorithms
The following algorithms are implemented in this project:

        1. Binary Search
        2. Selection Sort
        3. Insertion Sort
        4. Merge Sort
Getting Started
To get started with this project, you'll need to have Java installed on your machine. You can download the latest version of Java from the official website.

Once you have Java installed, you can clone this repository to your local machine:


Usage
To use the implementations in this project, simply import the relevant classes into your own Java code. For example, to use the linked list implementation, you would import the LinkedList class:
